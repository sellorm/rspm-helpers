# rspm-helpers

The goal of rspm-helpers is to provide some helpers to simplify working with [RStudio Package Manager](https://www.rstudio.com/products/package-manager/).

## create-mirror.sh

Creates a straight CRAN mirror - no messing about.

## create-internal.sh

Creates an empty repo that you can add your own packages to.

## create-curated.sh

Creates a curated CRAN repo from the `curated-list.txt` file.

This currently won't run as a transaction ID needs to be specified.
